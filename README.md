# Portfolio

This is my very first portfolio using ReactJS

Setup and run
To setup the project locally follow the instructions:

Clone
Note: For this you need to install git on your machine. You can download the git tool from here.

If you have forked the project, run the following command -

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/anitab-org.github.io

where YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME is your GitHub handle.

If you haven't forked the project, run the following command -

git clone https://github.com/anitab-org/anitab-org.github.io

Remote
Note: This is only needed if you want to contribute to the project.

When a repository is cloned, it has a default remote named origin that points to your fork on GitHub, not the original repository it was forked from. To keep track of the original repository, you should add another remote named upstream. For this project it can be done by running the following command -

git remote add upstream https://github.com/anitab-org/anitab-org.github.io

You can check that the previous command worked by running git remote -v. You should see the following output:

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/anitab-org.github.io (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/anitab-org.github.io (push)
upstream        https://github.com/anitab-org/anitab-org.github.io.git (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/anitab-org/anitab-org.github.io.git (push)
Run app
Download the latest stable version of NodeJs here and install it. Install yarn. Run node --version and yarn --version to verify successful installation.

To get the frontend running locally:

Clone this repository
yarn to install all required dependencies
yarn start to start the local server
